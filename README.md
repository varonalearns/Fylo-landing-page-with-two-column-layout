## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project, I learned to think ahead and better prepare structuring this project. I had a much easier time with this project than the last, mainly because I really thought of what needed to change as the screen sized changed. I also wanted to pay more attention to using semantic HTML and prepping for different colored SVGs.


### Continued development

In the future, I want to continue to think ahead and place the framing correctly before pouring in the foundation. I need to prep for different colored SVGs for instance. That is something to think about in the future.
